Weather App using js

This is a webapp that tells you the weather details of any given city. It provides info like temperature, humidity and wind speed and also the current weather condition (rainny/ clear/ mist).
In this project, apart from regular HTML, CSS and javascript I have also used an api to fetch the weather details. I've used OpenWeather api to fetch the info. It can also detect wrong city names.
